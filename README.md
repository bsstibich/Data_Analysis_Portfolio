# Data_Analysis_Portfolio
This repository acts as my portfolio to give any interested party an insight and showing of my data analytics skills!
Within this Portfolio I show off my abilites in 4 of the key Data analytics skills: Excel/Google Sheets, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Each project got its own dataset which also means that each project had its own data cleaning, insights, and challenges. 


To get the full picture of my work I would recomend downloading the repository to view on your computer.
